# Turtle Race Game
## Description
This Turtle Race Game is a simple Python script that uses the turtle module to create a fun and interactive racing game. Participants can bet on which turtle they think will win the race. The game features 6 different colored turtles racing towards the finish line. Users can enter their bet via a pop-up window at the beginning of the game.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
. Python 3.x

. Turtle Graphics Library

### Installing
No additional installation is required beyond Python itself. The Turtle Graphics Library comes standard with Python.

### Executing Program
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Save the script as turtle_race.py.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where turtle_race.py is saved.
5. Run the script using the following command:

   ``python turtle_race.py``
6. A window will pop up asking you to make your bet on the turtle's color.
7. Enjoy the race and see if your bet wins!


## How It Works
. The game initializes a screen and six turtles, each a different color.

. Users are prompted to bet on a turtle by entering the color they believe will win.

. Once a bet is made, the race starts, and each turtle moves a random distance forward.

. The first turtle to reach the finish line is declared the winner.

. The game announces whether the user's bet won or lost.
